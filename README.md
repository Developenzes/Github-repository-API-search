# Github-repository-API-search

Page that uses the GitHub API to list the repositories of a GitHub user.

This is a chalenge from javascript course by Jad Joubran: learnjavascript.online

The goal of this project is to allow the user to enter a GitHub username (for example, Developenzes), and then when the user submits the form, the app will show the list of GitHub repositories for that user using the GitHub API.
